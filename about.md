# [](#About)About

We offer an extra lesson service with the intent of optimising your potential. We do not only focus on subject content, but also effective ways to access and learn information. All our tutors are graduates in the fields of Mathematics and Science, and are intent on imparting knowledge to students, a rare alternative to the convential "parrot-style" learning. We track students' performance in order to report accurate data-based feedback. This is an important as improvement can only be expected if problems are clearly stated and identified. An effort is made to reduce fees when possible - we provide high quality tuition at a lower price.
