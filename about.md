# [](#About)About

We offer an extra lesson service that not only focuses on subject content, but also effective ways to access and learn information, and optimising students' potential. All our tutors are graduates in the fields of Mathematics or Science and are intent on imparting knowledge to students, an alternative to conventional “parrot-style” learning. We track students’ performance in order to accumulate accurate data-based feedback. This is an important step in the learning process, as improvement can only be made if problems are clearly identified. An effort is made to reduce fees when possible so as to provide high-quality tuition at a lower price.
