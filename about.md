# [](#About)About

This is a extra lesson service made with the intent of getting rid of the anoying aspects of extra lessons as we have experienced them.
The lessons are given by fully qualified individuals, a rare case in the world of extra lessons, who are intent on making their knowledge
something the students can call their own, also a rare alternative to the convential parrot style learning. We track performance in order 
to give accurate data based feedback and reporting. This is important as a diagnostic tool since recovery can only be expected if problems
can be clearly stated. An effort is made to reduce fees when possible and to faciliate those who require help at times tutors are 
ordinarily not available. We provide higher quality tuition at lower prices at higher levels of education.
